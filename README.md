
This is a simple dynamically typed pseudocode interpreter written in python. It runs the code according to the specified syntax defined in this file.

If you are using or learning psuedocode you can use this language to run simple frameworks making code more acessible and making it easier to correct mistakes when learning about pseudocode by actually testing your creations.

There are little scematics as all functions are pretty fundemental and staightforward.

Automatic variable assignment:
```DECLARE VARIABLE = x```

Input output is handled just like so:
```
x = INPUT "Enter Input: "
OUTPUT foo
```

Loops are done like so:
```
loop while

loop I from x to y

END loop
```

If statements look like loops:
```
IF foo

ELSE bar

END IF
```

Arrays are straightforward:
```
DECLARE array Integer [len, default]
array[index]
```

Boolean operators and operations:
```
+-
*/
%//
==/=/!=
></=><=

AND OR NOT
```

Subroutines are:
```
METHOD NAME[ARGUMENTS]
    
    RETURN x

END METHOD
```

File handling
Collections shall also be added such as dicts
